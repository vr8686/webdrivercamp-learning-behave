1. I am _banned_ on Target.com now. On any device on my IP I cannot see any products. Hope, it's temporarily... 
2. Time to time a meet StaleElementReferenceException but could not figure out why and how to avoid it. Just added exception to note the issue and let the script continue.
3. I have a feeling that I code like a barbarian. Could you please advise what can be improved?
